# Manual

This repository is an attempt to standardize most of our working
procedures for modern biological experiments. As a side product we
want to achieve real reproducible research, which is one the biggest
problems in modern science.

As we experienced the horror of hundreds of
\*insert-your-favorite-interpreter-language-here\* scripts floating
around without any documentation, we felt the need of a more
sophisticated approach. Thats why we are porting all our workflows to 
[Snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake/wiki/Home).

*Note: Every workflow is a work-in-progress an should be handeld as such.*

## What the repository contains

A list of all the workflows we are trying to port should follow soon.

## How it should be used.

Our workflows assume a certain directory structure which should be documented here.
